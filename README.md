# File Update Algorithm in Python

## Project Description
This project contains a Python script to update an access control list based on employee IP addresses. The script ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive patient records by maintaining an up-to-date allow list.

## How to Use
1. Place the `allow_list.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
2. Define the `remove_list` variable with the IP addresses to be removed.
3. Run the `file_update.py` script to update the allow list.

## Script Explanation
- Open the file that contains the allow list.
- Read the file contents into a string.
- Convert the string into a list.
- Iterate through the remove list and remove IP addresses.
- Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses.
